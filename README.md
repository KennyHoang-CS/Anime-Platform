# Misc. 
    More improvements are needed, such as optimization. There is a currently a bug when launch on Heroku, the landing video would not start another video and will loop the same video. I have implemented a temporary fix to that until I find out the bug on Heroku (may have to do with browser extensions, like adblock plus or script blockers).
